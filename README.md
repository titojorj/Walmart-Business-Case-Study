Walmart Business Case Study

Problem Statement
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between gender, Age, marital status, occupation, duration of stays in one city and other factors of the customers.


 Statistical Summary (Analyzing the Basic Metrics)
Total Customer Base: There are a total of 550068 customer details.
Age Diversity: The dataset includes 7 unique age groups. The age group 26-35 has the highest number of transactions, with a total of 219,587. 
Product_ID: In the 550,068 transactions, there are 3,631 different products. The product with the code P00265242 is the top seller, having sold a maximum of 1,880 units.
Gender: Among the 550,068 transactions, 414,259  transactions were made by males. This indicates a significant difference in buying behavior between males and females.
Stay_In_Current_City_Years: Customers who have stayed in the current city for 1 year account for the highest number of transactions, reaching 193,821. 
User_ID: Out of 550,068 transactions, there are 5,891 unique user IDs. 
Marital_Status: Unmarried customers made up 324731 of the total transactions, while married customers accounted for 225337.
Purchase:The amounts people spent on purchases show a big range. The smallest purchase was $12, while the biggest one was as high as $23,961. The middle point, or median purchase, is $8,047, which is less than the average purchase amount of $9,264. This suggests that the majority of purchases are lower in value, but there are a few very expensive purchases that make the average higher. It's like the data is leaning more towards the right side indicating a right-skewed distribution.

Multivariate Analysis
Purchase vs Gender vs Marital Status vs Stay in the current city

Observations
Across age groups, the median values for females aged 18-25 are notably the lowest, while the medians for other age categories exhibit comparable values. Conversely, the highest median values are consistently observed in the 51-55 age group.
Examining city categories, both females and males exhibit the highest median spending in city category C compared to cities A and B.
Marital status appears to have no discernible impact on spending habits for both genders. However, it is noteworthy that median spending values for males tend to be higher than those for females.
Delving into the duration of stay, female spending patterns reveal slightly lower median values for those residing for 0 and 3 years compared to other durations.

Constructing the Confidence Interval of 95% for sample sizes of [30,300,3000,30000]

As the purchase amount distribution is not Normal. So we will be using the Central Limit Theorem. It states the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying population distribution.


After building the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) curve, we will create a confidence interval predicting population mean at 95% Confidence level. 
We will use three different sample sizes of - [30,300,3000,30000]


Gender vs Purchase



Observations
It indicates that as the sample size increases, confidence intervals become more refined and narrower. In the context of business, this implies that larger sample sizes contribute to more dependable insights and precise estimates.

It is evident that, with the exception of the Sample Size of 30 and 300, confidence intervals do not overlap as the sample size grows. This implies that the average spending per transaction between men and women.

With 95% confidence, the average for spending among males lies within the range of $9,393 to $9,483, and for females, it falls between $8,692 and $8,777.
Men tend to spend more per transaction than women. 

Marital Status vs Purchase




At 95% confident that the true population average for married customers falls between $9,217 and $9,305, and for unmarried customers, it falls between $9,222 and $9,311.

The overlapping confidence intervals of average spending for married and unmarried customers indicate that both married and unmarried customers spend a similar amount per transaction. This implies a resemblance in spending behavior between the two groups.




Age vs Purchase



We can say that age group does not have much effect on the spending of customers as their interval range is overlapping with 95% confidence intervals.

Recommendations
Gender-Specific Recommendations:
Target Male Customer Retention and Acquisition, Recognizing that men spend more than women, the company should prioritize retaining existing male customers and attracting new ones.
Tailored Marketing for Females, Since females generally spend less, the company should develop targeted marketing strategies to address their specific needs and potentially increase their spending.
Product Category Strategy:
Products in categories 1, 5, 8, and 11 show high purchasing frequency, indicating customer preferences. The company should focus on increasing sales of these products and explore strategies to promote less-purchased items.
Focusing on Unmarried Customers:
Unmarried customers exhibit higher spending compared to married customers. The company should concentrate on acquiring and retaining unmarried customers.
Age-Specific Marketing:
Engage Younger Consumers with Incentives (0-17 Years),Customers in the 0-17 age group have the lowest spending per transaction. To attract more young shoppers, the company can offer games and incentives tailored to the preferences of the younger generation, creating a more engaging and enjoyable shopping environment. Implementing special offers and games for the 0-17 age group can attract families and boost sales.
Attract Younger Shoppers with Games(18-25), Introducing games in the mall can attract a younger audience and contribute to increased sales. Management should explore interactive strategies to engage younger customers.
Tailor Offerings (26-45),  Given that the age group 26-45 drives the majority of sales, Walmart should tailor its product selection offering exclusive deals on popular products.
Enhance Shopping Experience for Age Group 51-55, The 51-55 age group exhibits the highest spending per transaction. Walmart can enhance their shopping experience through exclusive pre-sale access, special discounts, and personalized recommendations.
City_Category C Revenue Boost:
Male customers in City_Category C spend more than those in other categories. Increasing product offerings and marketing efforts targeting the males in City_Category C can enhance overall revenue.
